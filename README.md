🙋‍♂️ I'm Lazar.

🎓 I'm a PhD graduate from the [Institute of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I built [KITE-BCI](https://www.uhn.ca/corporate/News/Pages/Getting_a_good_grip.aspx), the brain-computer interface system developed to work with functional electrical stimulaiton therapy for the recovery of arm and hand movement after stroke or spinal cord injury.

🔬 I'm a postdoctoral researcher and co-director of operations at [WearTech Labs](https://www.sfu.ca/research/facilities/weartech-labs), a new core facility at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/). My research is focused on exoskeletons designed to enhance human running.

🔭 I'm also a cofounder at [Summations](https://www.summations.com) working to bring the latest academic research into undergradute classrooms.

📕 I'm currently learning [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/). Before this, I was learning [multibody dynamics](https://moorepants.github.io/learn-multibody-dynamics/).

💬 Ask me about `electrophysiological signals`, `signal processing`, `brain-computer interfacing`, `functional electrical stimulation`, `biomechanics`, `exoskeletons`, `3D printing`.
